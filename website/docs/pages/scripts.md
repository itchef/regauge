# Scripts

Inside the newly created project, you can run some built-in commands:

| Tasks                     |                        Description                        |
|---------------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------:|
| **npm start**             |    Boots your application up on http://localhost:8080/    |
| **npm build**             |        Builds your application in production mode.        |
| **npm test**              | Run jest unit test cases of the newly created application |
| **npm run test:coverage** |          Run jest unit test cases with coverage           |
| **npm run test:watch**    |          Run jest unit test cases on watch mode           |
